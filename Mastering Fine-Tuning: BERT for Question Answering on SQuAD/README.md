# Mastering Fine-Tuning: BERT for Question Answering on SQuAD

## Overview
**Mastering Fine-Tuning: BERT for Question Answering on SQuAD** is a project focused on fine-tuning the BERT model to tackle question-answering tasks using the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). This notebook serves as a practical guide for leveraging transfer learning in natural language processing, showcasing how pre-trained models can be adapted for specific tasks.

## Notebook Purpose
The notebook demonstrates the complete workflow for fine-tuning BERT on the SQuAD dataset. It includes steps for loading the dataset, preprocessing the data through tokenization, preparing training features, setting training parameters, and utilizing the Hugging Face Trainer class to train the model effectively. By the end of the notebook, users will have a trained BERT model capable of answering questions based on context passages, providing a solid foundation for further exploration in NLP.

## Project Highlights

- **Objective**
  - Fine-tune a BERT model for answering questions using the SQuAD dataset.

- **Dataset**
  - Utilizes the SQuAD dataset, a standard benchmark for evaluating question-answering systems.

- **Model**
  - Implements the BERT architecture, leveraging pre-trained weights for enhanced performance.

### Key Features

- **Tokenization**
  - Efficiently processes and tokenizes input questions and context passages.

- **Overflow Handling**
  - Manages long inputs with overlapping tokens to ensure all relevant information is considered.

- **Training Configuration**
  - Customizable training parameters (e.g., batch size, learning rate, epochs) for tailored experimentation.

- **Data Collation**
  - Automatically pads input sequences within batches for uniformity during training.

### Training and Evaluation

- **Trainer Class**
  - Uses the Hugging Face Trainer class to simplify the training loop and evaluate model performance.
